Interviewer: Good morning. How are you doing today?
Participant: I'm doing quite well, thank you. It's a beautiful day outside, isn't it?

Participant: Of course. I usually wake up around seven, read the morning paper with my coffee. Then I do some gardening or yard work if the weather is nice. I have lunch, often with a friend, and then I might work on a hobby or read a book.

Interviewer: What are some of your hobbies?
Participant: Well, I enjoy woodworking. I've been doing that for many years. I also like to paint watercolors, though I'm not very good at it. And I do crossword puzzles regularly. They keep the mind sharp, I think.
